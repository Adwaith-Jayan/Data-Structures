Data Structures Using C
Questions

C BASICS
1. You are given two arrays sorted in ascending order. Write a C Program to merge the elements of the 
two arrays and to form a single array sorted in ascending order.
2. Given a string s, write a C program to find the length of the longest substring without repeating 
characters. Also, display the substring.
3. Write a program to find the smallest number in a list of integers using pointers
4. Implement the following string library functions using pointers:
 string length (int StringLengh (char *s))
 string copy (void StringCopy(char *s1, char *s2) )
 string comparison (int StringCompare (char *s1, char *s2))
 string concatenation (void StringConcat(char *s1, char *s2) )
5. Implement bubble sort without using array (Use pointers instead)


SEARCHING & STACKS
1. Implement Linear Search.
2. Implement Binary Search.
3. Implement Stack using array.
4. Write a program in C to check whether a string is palindrome or not, using stack.


STACK AND QUEUE APPLICATIONS

1.Using stack, convert an infix expression to a postfix expression and evaluate the postfix expression.
2.Write a program to convert an infix expression to a prefix expression using stack.
3.Convert an infix expression to a postfix expression without using stack.
4.Implement a Queue using arrays with the operations:
   a.Insert elements into the queue
   b.Delete elements from the queue
   c.Display the contents of the queue after each operation
5.Implement a Circular Queue using arrays with the operations:
   a.Insert elements into the queue
   b.Delete elements from the queue
   c.Display the contents of the queue after each operation
6.Implement a Priority Queue using arrays with the operations:
   a.Insert elements into the queue
   b.Delete elements from the queue
   c.Display the contents of the queue after each operation
7.Implement a Double Ended Queue using arrays with the operations:
   a.Insert elements into the queue (both front and rear)
   b.Delete elements from the queue (both front and rear)
   c.Display the contents of the queue after each operation


LINKED LIST & APPLICATION

1.Write a menu driven program for performing the following operations on a linked list
    1. Display
    2. Insert at beginning
    3. Insert at end
    4. Insert at a specified position
    5. Delete from beginning
    6. Delete from end
    7. Delete from a specified position   
2. Create a doubly linked list from a string taking each character from the string. Check if the string is 
palindrome in a efficient method.
3.Implement a stack using linked list with the operations:
    1. Push 
    2. Pop
    3. Display the contents of the stack
4.
